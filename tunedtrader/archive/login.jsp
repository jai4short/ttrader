        <p> Welcome to TunedTrader.com.  We would like to thank you for your interest in the site and we encourage you to provide as much feedback as possible.  Before creating your beta user account you must first read through and accept the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement detailed below:

        <br>
        <br>
        <h1> Non Disclosure Agreement </h1>

        <p> THIS AGREEMENT ("the agreement") is entered on INSERT TIMESTAMP between Tunedtrader.com ("the disclosing party") and the current beta tester ("the user") whose information is to be provided below.  The Recipient hereto desires to participate in digital interactions regarding the functionality and technical design of Tunedtrader.com 
(the “Transaction”). During these interactions, Disclosing Party may share certain proprietary 
information with the Recipient. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants 
contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of 
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
        <br>
        
        <h2> 1. Definition of Confidential Information </h1>
        <br>
        <p>(a) For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any data or 
information that is proprietary to the Tunedtreader and not generally known to the public, whether in 
tangible or intangible form, whenever and however disclosed, including, but not limited to: (i) any 
marketing strategies, plans, financial information, or projections, operations, sales estimates, business 
plans and performance results relating to the past, present or future business activities of such party, its 
affiliates, subsidiaries and affiliated companies; (ii) plans for products or services, and customer or 
supplier lists; (iii) any scientific or technical information, invention, design, process, procedure, formula, 
improvement, technology or method; (iv) any concepts, reports, data, know-how, works-in-progress, 
designs, development tools, specifications, computer software, source code, object code, flow charts, 
databases, inventions, information and trade secrets; and (v) any other information that should reasonably 
be recognized as confidential information of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information need not be 
novel, unique, patentable, copyrightable or constitute a trade secret in order to be designated Confidential 
Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the Confidential Information is proprietary to the 
Disclosing Party, has been developed and obtained through great efforts by the Disclosing Party and that 
Disclosing Party regards all of its Confidential Information as trade secrets 

<br> <br>

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Confidential 
Information shall not include information which: (i) was known by the Receiving Party prior to receiving 
the Confidential Information from the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes rightfully known to the Receiving 
Party from a third-party source not known (after diligent inquiry) by the Receiving Party to be under an 
obligation to Disclosing Party to maintain confidentiality; (c) is or becomes publicly available through no 
fault of or failure to act by the Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement; (d) is required to be disclosed 
in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or is otherwise requested or required to be disclosed by law or 
regulation, although the requirements of paragraph 4 hereof shall apply prior to any disclosure being 
made; and (e) is or has been independently developed by employees, consultants or agents of the 
Receiving Party without violation of the terms of this Agreement or reference or access to any 
Confidential Information. 

<br>

<h2> 2. Use of Confidential Information</h2>

<br>

<p> The Receiving Party agrees to use the Confidential Information solely in connection with 
the current or contemplated business relationship between the parties and not for any purpose other than 
as authorized by this Agreement without the prior written consent of an authorized representative of the 
Disclosing Party. No other right or license, whether expressed or implied, in the Confidential Information 
is granted to the Receiving Party hereunder. Title to the Confidential Information will remain solely in 
the Disclosing Party. All use of Confidential Information by the Receiving Party shall be for the benefit 
of the Disclosing Party and any modifications and improvements thereof by the Receiving Party shall be 
the sole property of the Disclosing Party. Nothing contained herein is intended to modify the parties' 
existing agreement that their discussions in furtherance of a potential business relationship are governed 
by Federal Rule of Evidence 408. 

<br> <br>

<h2> 3. Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information </h2>

<br> 

<p> Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Receiving Party may 
disclose Confidential Information pursuant to any governmental, judicial, or administrative order, 
subpoena, discovery request, regulatory request or similar method, provided that the Receiving Party 
promptly notifies, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party in writing of such demand for disclosure 
so that the Disclosing Party, at its sole expense, may seek to make such disclosure subject to a protective 
order or other appropriate remedy to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information; 
provided in the case of a broad regulatory request with respect to the Receiving Party’s business (not 
targeted at Disclosing Party), the Receiving Party may promptly comply with such request provided the 
Receiving Party give (if permitted by such regulator) the Disclosing Party prompt notice of such 
disclosure. The Receiving Party agrees that it shall not oppose and shall cooperate with efforts by, to the 
extent practicable, the Disclosing Party with respect to any such request for a protective order or other 
relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Disclosing Party is unable to obtain or does not seek a 
protective order and the Receiving Party is legally requested or required to disclose such Confidential 
Information, disclosure of such Confidential Information may be made without liability

<br> <br>

<h2> 4. Term </h2>

<br> <br> 

<p> This Agreement shall remain in effect for a two-year term (subject to a one year 
extension if the parties are still discussing and considering the Transaction at the end of the second year). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties’ duty to hold in confidence Confidential Information that was 
disclosed during term shall remain in effect indefinitely. 

<br> <br>

<h2> 5. Remedies</h2>

<br> <br> 

<p> Both parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information to be disclosed hereunder is 
of a unique and valuable character, and that the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would destroy or diminish the value of such information. The damages to Disclosing Party 
that would result from the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would be 
impossible to calculate. Therefore, both parties hereby agree that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to 
injunctive relief preventing the dissemination of any Confidential Information in violation of the terms 
hereof. Such injunctive relief shall be in addition to any other remedies available hereunder, whether at 
law or in equity. Disclosing Party shall be entitled to recover its costs and fees, including reasonable 
attorneys’ fees, incurred in obtaining any such relief. Further, in the event of litigation relating to this 
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses. 

<br> <br>

<h2> 6. Return of Confidential Information</h2>

<br> <br> 

<p> Receiving Party shall immediately return and redeliver to the other all tangible material 
embodying the Confidential Information provided hereunder and all notes, summaries, memoranda, 
drawings, manuals, records, excerpts or derivative information deriving there from and all other 
documents or materials (“Notes”) (and all copies of any of the foregoing, including “copies” that have 
been converted to computerized media in the form of image, data or word processing files either manually 
or by image capture) based on or including any Confidential Information, in whatever form of storage or 
retrieval, upon the earlier of (i) the completion or termination of the dealings between the parties 
contemplated hereunder; (ii) the termination of this Agreement; or (iii) at such time as the Disclosing 
Party may so request; provided however that the Receiving Party may retain such of its documents as is 
necessary to enable it to comply with its document retention policies. Alternatively, the Receiving Party, 
with the written consent of the Disclosing Party may (or in the case of Notes, at the Receiving Party’s 
option) immediately destroy any of the foregoing embodying Confidential Information (or the reasonably 
nonrecoverable data erasure of computerized data) and, upon request, certify in writing such destruction 
by an authorized officer of the Receiving Party supervising the destruction). 

<br> <br>

<h2> 7. Notice of Breach </h2>

<br> <br> 

<p> Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any 
unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information by Receiving Party or its Representatives, or 
any other breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party or its Representatives, and will cooperate with 
efforts by the Disclosing Party to help the Disclosing Party regain possession of Confidential Information 
and prevent its further unauthorized use. 

<br> <br>

<h2> 8. No Binding Agreement for Transaction</h2>

<br> <br> 

<p>

The parties agree that neither party will be under any legal obligation of any kind 
whatsoever with respect to a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically 
agreed to herein. The parties further acknowledge and agree that they each reserve the right, in their sole 
and absolute discretion, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations with 
respect to a Transaction at any time. This Agreement does not create a joint venture or partnership 
between the parties. If a Transaction goes forward, the non-disclosure provisions of any applicable 
transaction documents entered into between the parties (or their respective affiliates) for the Transaction 
shall supersede this Agreement. In the event such provision is not provided for in said transaction 
documents, this Agreement shall control. 

<br> <br>

<h2> 9. Warranty</h2>

<br> <br> 

<p>

Each party warrants that it has the right to make the disclosures under this Agreement. 
NO WARRANTIES ARE MADE BY EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT 
WHATSOEVER. The parties acknowledge that although they shall each endeavor to include in the 
Confidential Information all information that they each believe relevant for the purpose of the evaluation 
of a Transaction, the parties understand that no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or 
completeness of the Confidential Information is being made by either party as the Disclosing Party. 
Further, neither party is under any obligation under this Agreement to disclose any Confidential 
Information it chooses not to disclose. Neither Party hereto shall have any liability to the other party or to 
the other party’s Representatives resulting from any use of the Confidential Information except with 
respect to disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement. 

<br> <br>

<h2> 10. Miscellaneous</h2>

<br> <br> 

<p>

(a) This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and 
supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, 
between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can only be modified by a 
written amendment signed by the party against whom enforcement of such modification is sought. 
(b) The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed 

<br> <br>
and construed in accordance with the laws of Georgia (state) applicable to contracts

exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under the terms of this Agreement.

provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to subsequently enforce such 
provision or any other provision of this Agreement. 

<br> <br>

(d) Although the restrictions contained in this Agreement are considered by the 
parties to be reasonable for the purpose of protecting the Confidential Information, if any such restriction 
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be modified, 
rewritten or interpreted to include as much of its nature and scope as will render it enforceable. If it 
cannot be so modified, rewritten or interpreted to be enforceable in any respect, it will not be given effect, 
and the remainder of the Agreement will be enforced as if such provision was not included.

be delivered by hand, deposited with a nationally recognized overnight carrier, electronic-mail, or mailed

the case of personal delivery or electronic-mail, on the date of such delivery, (b) in the case of delivery by 
a nationally recognized overnight carrier, on the third business day following dispatch and (c) in the case 
of mailing, on the seventh business day following such mailing. 

<br> <br>

assign or transfer it by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other party, 
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. All obligations contained in this Agreement shall 
extend to and be binding upon the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors, assigns and 
designees. 

<br> <br>

(g) The receipt of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement will not 
prevent or in any way limit either party from: (i) developing, making or marketing products or services 
that are or may be competitive with the products or services of the other; or (ii) providing products or 
services to others who compete with the other. 

<br> <br>
